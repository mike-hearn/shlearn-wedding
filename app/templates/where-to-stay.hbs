<h2>TRAVEL</h2>

<p>
Grafton is a bit off the beaten path (part of its charm, we promise). Please
visit the <a

  target="_blank">Grafton Inn website</a> for travel tips.</p>
<p>There is no cell service in the area and even GPS can be spotty, so please
bring printed driving directions to and from the venue.
